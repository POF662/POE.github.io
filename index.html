            <h2>Welcome to Proof-of-Fitness</h2>
            <p>Proof-of-Fitness (PoF) is an upcoming blockchain-based fitness rewards platform that turns your physical activity into valuable tokens. We aim to motivate users to maintain a healthy lifestyle by rewarding every step, run, and workout. Whether youâ€™re a fitness enthusiast or just starting your journey, PoF will create real-world value for your efforts.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Stage:</strong> We are preparing for our initial presale and fundraising phase on PinkSale. The funds raised will be used to develop our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), establish partnerships, and build the core platform functionality.</p>

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Proof-of-Fitness aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the fitness community by creating a transparent, rewards-based ecosystem. Users will be able to connect their fitness apps, track activities, and earn PoF tokens, which can be redeemed for fitness gear, premium memberships, and more. The ultimate goal is to create a community-driven platform where fitness is not only beneficial but also rewarding.</p>
            <p>We are in the **conceptual phase** and are looking to raise $35,000 - $50,000 to fund our MVP development. The MVP will initially focus on Google Fit and Strava integrations and a basic rewards dashboard.</p>
